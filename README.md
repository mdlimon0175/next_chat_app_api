#### `auth_checker` 
Receives a token string and emits a socket event. If the token is verified, an `auth_success` event is emitted; otherwise, an `auth_failed` event is emitted.

### Call events
- If request is invalid, emit `call_error`.

#### `call_outgoing`
Receives a `room_id (conversation_id)` and emits a single event based on the status of the active call and the callee's availability:
- If an existing call is found, emit `rejoin_exist_call`.
- If callee on an existing call, emit `call_end`.
- If the calleeâ€™s socket is not active, emit `call_end`.
- If the callee declines or rejects the call, emit `call_end`.
- If the callee accepts the call, emit `call_data` with the call information.

#### `call_joined`
Receives `{ caller_id, call_id }` and emits a single event based on request data. \
After `call_ongoing` successful event, callee emit on `call_joined` to inform caller that callee joined the call.
- If call status is active, it's check caller socket is active or not and based on this emit `call_data` or `call_end`. and emit `rejoin_exist_call` for caller.
- If call status is not active, then emit an event for caller `callee_joined`.


#### `call_offer_sdp`
Receives ` {room_id, offer, rejoin: boolean} ` and emits a single event based on request data.
- If request.rejoin true check callee socket active or not. if not active emit `call_end` else emit `call_data`.
- Finally emit an event for callee with `caller_offer_sdp` or `caller_rejoin_offer_sdp` and on callback received a `answer` from callee and emit socket `callee_answer_sdp` with answer to caller.
- data.offer and data.answer included the offer or answer.

#### `call_hangup`

- emit `call_end` for room_id.

#### `ice_candidate`
Receives ` {room_id, call_id, candidate} ` and emits a single event based on request data. Help to change ice_candidate.
- emit `ice_candidate` and data.candidate includes the candidate information.

#### `call_toggle_stream`
Receives ` {stream_type: 'video'|'audio', stream_status: boolean, call_id, room_id} ` help to inform partner about stream toggle status.
- emit `call_remote_video_stream_toggled` or `call_remote_audio_stream_toggled` based on stream_type and data.status have the stream_status value.
